    coreg_notes: "Tom Logan's coregistration delivered 2022-10-31. His notes via email:\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nAttached
      are some slides and GeoTiff files that show the current co-registration status
      for the LO_3133_res3 to NAC M1096608496RE test case. Starting with the provided
      map-projected LO image, we scale the LO image to match the NAC resolution, and
      manually offset the LO by 489 lines and 1748 samples. We then apply the co-registration
      program (actually twice). Further refinements are TBD, but the initial co-registration
      does a good job of aligning the major craters. However, the internal geometry
      of the LO image is rather poor, and many of the smaller intervening craters
      get warped and pushed out of position."
